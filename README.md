# docs

`docs` is based on any wordpress theme, I'll transform it to a plugin when finished.

It provides **CMS / file tree system** to wordpress. So you can make wordpress a wiki system or something else.

This repository is base on the `wordpress Twenty Fourteen theme`.

### Usage

Just copy the `docs` folder to `/wp-content/themes/` and enable the theme.

### Info

I modified `functions.php`, added `docs_dir_select.js` and `docs_dir_select.css`. All the other files are in the default theme.

`Font awesome` and `jQuery` are also included.

### Author / License

This plugin is developed for `Fudan STU Wiki System`.
